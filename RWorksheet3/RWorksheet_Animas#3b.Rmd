#a Write the codes.

#b. Describe the data. Get the structure or the summary of the data
#The data surveys a total of 20 respondents,it shows data like sex, Fathers occupation, Persons at home,Siblings at school and types of houses,the data gathers informations of the respondents.

#c. Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5?
mean_of_siblings<-mean(df[,5])
mean_of_siblings
#The mean number of siblings is not 5 the mean number is 2.95

#d. Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the subsetting functions. Write the codes and its output.
first_two<-df[1:2,]
first_two

#e. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column. Write the codes and its result.
Third_Fifth<-df[c(3,5), c(2,4)]
Third_Fifth

#f. Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that results as types_houses. Write the codes.
Types_Houses<-df[,6]
Types_Houses

#g. Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was farmer. Write the codes and its output.
Males<-subset(df, df[,2] == 1 & df[,3] == 1 )

#h. Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school. Write the codes and its outputs.

#2. Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes:

#df = data.frame(Ints=integer(), Doubles=double(), Characters=character(), Logicals=logical(), Factors=factor(),stringsAsFactors=FALSE) print("Structure of the empty dataframe:") print(str(df))

#a. Describe the results.
df = data.frame(Ints=integer(),
Doubles=double(), Characters=character(),
Logicals=logical(),
Factors=factor(),
stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
print(str(df))

#The code shows an empty data frame named df in R with 5 variables (Ints, Doubles, Characters, Logicals and Factors) and 0 observations.
